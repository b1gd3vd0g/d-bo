# D-Bo

**D-Bo** is a multiplayer card game similar to Skip-Bo, where players can play with each other in real time.

The backend of D-Bo consists of a single Rust binary crate, empowering a REST API as well as WebSocket capability for real-time multiplayer interaction.

The database currently relied upon is MongoDB - soon, however, a redis database will be created and used for caching.

The frontend is a React application, using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

This project is **under active development** - check back soon for updates!
