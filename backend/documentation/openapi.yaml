      summary: Create a new player account.
      description: |
        This endpoint is used when a player is registering a new account for D-Bo. A successful
        request results in the Player document being inserted into the database, a **Confirmation
        Token** being generated (used to confirm a player's email; good for 15 minutes), and
        a **registration email** being sent to the provided email address, welcoming them to the 
        application and providing them with a link to confirm their account.
        
        ## Request Body

        The body contains all the necessary information in order to create a new account.
        
        The first type of information required is the player's **login credentials** - their
        username, email address, and password. The following rules are enforced for a player's login
        credentials:
        
        **username**:
        
        - Must be between 6 and 16 characters
        - May only include letters, numbers, and underscores
        - It may not start with an underscore
        - It may not contain two or more consecutive underscores
        
        **password**:

        - Must be between 8 and 32 characters
        - Must include at least one of each of the following:
          - An uppercase letter
          - A lowercase letter     
          - A number
          - One of the following symbols: `! @ # $ % ^ & * + = ?`
        - It may not contain any spaces or symbols not listed above
        
        **email**:

        - It must contain a single `@` character, separating the **prefix** and the **domain**
        - The prefix must not:
          - Be an empty string
          - Contain characters other than letters, numbers, and the following symbols: `. _ + -`
          - Begin nor end with a dot
          - Contain consecutive dots
        - The domain must not:
          - Be an empty string
          - Contain characters other than letters, numbers, dots, and hyphens
        - Each **level** (separated by dots) of the domain must not:
          - Be an empty string
          - Begin nor end with a hyphen
        - The **top level domain** (the final level) must contain two or more characters
        
        Additionally, the *email* and *username* fields must be **case-insensitively unique** to any
        others which exist in the database.

        Also required in this request is the player's gender and preferred language, which have a
        unique relationship to the *pronoun* field. The *pronoun* field is set to match the player's
        gender in all cases but the following:

        Spanish-speaking players with a non-binary gender get to choose how they should be referred
        to with gendered language. This is important because there is no **universally accepted**
        way to refer to non-binary people in Spanish. There is a fairly new trend involving "-e"
        endings, but some players may not prefer this; therefore, they are given the choice of how
        they should be referred to. The table below provides an example:

        | Pronoun | "(He/She/They) have been your friend for 1 month." |
        | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
        | m       | "Ã‰l ha sido su amigo por un mes."                  |
        | f       | "Ella ha sido su amiga por un mes."                |
        | nb      | "Elle ha sido su amigue por un mes."               |

        A player's pronouns are used to customize the game interface, email correspondences, etc.

      summary: Confirm a newly registered account.
      description: |
        This endpoint is used to verify a new player's email address. This marks the account as
        "confirmed", which allows the player to start logging in and utilizing the functionality of
        the application. This request requires that a **confirmation token** exists within the
        database, and that it is *not expired* - confirmation tokens expire after **15 minutes**.

        During account registration, a link is provided in the registration email to a page where 
        the player can click a button to confirm their account and start playing. If the **token** 
        represented by the *token_id* path parameter is found to be **expired**, the player will
        have to request a new token, receive a new email, and follow that link within 15 minutes.

        It is important to note: confirmation tokens and *unconfirmed* player accounts are
        automatically deleted from the database after **two days** - after two days without
        confirming the account, the player must register again if they wish to play.

        Additionally, there may only ever be a single confirmation token associated with any single
        player account in the database at any time. So, if a new email is sent with a new token
        link, **all previously provided links** will be rendered obsolete.

        Upon success, the used confirmation token will be deleted from the database.

      description: |
        This endpoint is used to **reject** an account registration. This would mostly be used in
        the case that somebody has received a registration email by mistake. It will immediately
        delete all information related to the associated account.

        Unlike the POST request to confirm a new account, this endpoint will work regardless of
        whether the confirmation token has expired 15 minutes after creation; it simply requires
        that the player account (associated with the player_id) and the confirmation token 
        (associated with the token_id) **both** exist within the database.

        It is important to note: confirmation tokens and *unconfirmed* player accounts are
        automatically deleted from the database after **two days**. If this request is attempted,
        and neither can be found, that likely means that the account has already been deleted (or 
        that the request did not correspond with any existing account). In this case, a success
        response is *still returned*, because all traces of the count have been erased, which was 
        the goal all along.

      summary: Attempt to log in via username/email and password.
      description: |
        This endpoint is called whenever a user attempts to log in with their username and password.
        Upon success, this endpoint will return an **access token** in the response body, which can 
        be used to authenticate the player for the next **15 minutes**.
        
        This endpoint also generates a **refresh token** for the player, and returns it to the
        client via an **HTTP-only cookie** which will automatically be shared with the **POST
        /players/refresh** endpoint.
        
        The most common cause of failure for this function is an authentication failure, meaning the
        provided username/email and password combination does not match the records stored in the 
        database.
        
        A 500 response could be returned in the case that the database connection failed, or in the
        very unlikely case that an internal adapter has failed within the application.
